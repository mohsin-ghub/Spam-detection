# 📩 Spam Detection Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Spam Detection System** that classifies messages as **Spam** or **Ham** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages and utilizes **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction and **Logistic Regression** for classification.  

## ⚙️ Features  
✅ Preprocesses text (lowercasing, removing punctuation & extra spaces)  
✅ Converts text into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**  
✅ Uses **Logistic Regression** for spam classification  
✅ Achieves **high accuracy (~97%)** on test data  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Scikit-Learn** (for ML model & metrics)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data handling)  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** (for text processing)
